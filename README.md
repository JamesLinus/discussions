Meteor core community discussions
================================

Track discussions about application development in Meteor

Contributions, members, ideas and opinions are welcome here!!

Let us coordinate efforts creating new packages, pull requests, patterns or guidlines for Meteor.

We could use this as base/topics for a monthly package developer/core Hangout discussion

-

## WARNING!
I will sometimes remove comments and add it to the issue description - Its an attempt to keep the discussions clean whilst having a brief summary of the discussion

You are most welcome to protest if you feel violated :)

-

## Labels

I'll try to manage labels regarding to what parts of Meteor the discussion affects.

I'm using labels to track the status of a discussion:
* Discussion - We are trying to define the actual problem to solve
* Potential Pull Request - A solution is near
* If solved the issue is closed

-

## Debate

In a discussion we don't actually have to agree on things! __Core__ developers and __App__ developers face different problems.
We just have to figure out how we can write better apps that are still performant/scalable - There will often be a natural conflict of interest :)

The issue will be marked:
* Community agrees
* Community doen't agree
* MDG agrees
* MDG doesn't agree

-

Want to help out? Join the team, help organize and

* filter in threads from the Google Groups: [meteor-talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-talk) and especially [meteor-core](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-core)
* bring in relevant [Meteor issues](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues).

Kind regards Morten (aka RaiX)
