Meteor core community discussions
================================

Track discussions about application development in Meteor

Contributions, members, ideas and opinions are welcome here!!

Let us coordinate efforts creating new packages, pull requests, patterns or guidlines for Meteor.

-

## WARNING!
I will sometimes remove comments and add it to the issue description - Its an attempt to keep the discussions clean whilst having a brief summary of the discussion

You are most welcome to protest if you feel violated :)

-

## Labels

I'll try to manage labels regarding to what parts of Meteor the discussion affects.

I'm using labels to track the status of a discussion:
* Discussion - We are trying to define the actual problem to solve
* Potential Pull Request - A solution is near
* If solved the issue is closed

-

## Debate

In a discussion we dont actually have to agree on things! __Core__ developers and __App__ developers face different problems.
We just have to figure out how we can write better apps that are still performant/scaleable - There will often be a natural conflict of interest :)

The issue will be marked:
* Community agree
* Community dont agree
* MDG agree
* MDG dont agree

Want to help out? Join the team, help organize and filter out things from google groups and Meteor issues etc.

Kind regards Morten (aka RaiX)
